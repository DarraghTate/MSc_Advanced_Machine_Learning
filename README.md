# MSc_Advanced_Machine_Learning
Some minor machine learning assigments that were required for my MSc in Software Design with Artificial Intelligence in Athlone Institute of Technology.

Minor_Exercise_Data_Discovery demonstrates the use of different machine learning regression functions with the diamonds dataset to try and predict prices.

Minor_Exercise_Text_Classification uses different machine learning categorisation functions and sentiment analysis to categorise the newsgroups dataset by topic.
